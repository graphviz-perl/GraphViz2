=head1 NAME

GraphViz2::Config - A wrapper for AT&T's Graphviz

=head1 Synopsis

See L<GraphViz2>.

=head1 Description

L<GraphViz2> provides a wrapper for AT&T's Graphviz.

=head1 Methods

=head2 _init()

For use by subclasses.

Sets default values for object attributes.

=head2 new()

For use by subclasses.

=head2 read()

read() is called by new(). It does the actual reading of the config file.

If the file can't be read, die is called.

The path to the config file is determined by:

	File::Spec -> catfile(File::HomeDir -> my_dist_config('GraphViz2'), '.htgraphviz2.conf');

During installation, you should have run scripts/copy.config.pl, which uses the same code, to move the config file
from the config/ directory in the disto into an OS-dependent directory.

The run-time code uses this module to look in the same directory as used by scripts/copy.config.pl.

=head1 Version Numbers

Version numbers < 1.00 represent development versions. From 1.00 up, they are production versions.
