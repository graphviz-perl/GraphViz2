=head1 NAME

L<GraphViz2::Parse::STT> - Visualize a Set::FA::Element state transition table as a graph

=head1 Synopsis

	#!/usr/bin/env perl

	use strict;
	use warnings;

	use File::Spec;

	use GraphViz2;
	use GraphViz2::Parse::STT;

	use File::Slurp; # For read_file().

	my($graph)  = GraphViz2 -> new
		(
		 edge   => {color => 'grey'},
		 global => {directed => 1},
		 graph  => {rankdir => 'TB'},
		 node   => {color => 'green', shape => 'oval'},
		);
	my($g)  = GraphViz2::Parse::STT -> new(graph => $graph);
	my $stt = read_file(File::Spec -> catfile('t', 'sample.stt.1.dat') );

	$g -> create(stt => $stt);

	my($format)      = shift || 'svg';
	my($output_file) = shift || File::Spec -> catfile('html', "parse.stt.$format");

	$graph -> run(format => $format, output_file => $output_file);

See scripts/parse.stt.pl (L<GraphViz2/Scripts Shipped with this Module>).

Note: t/sample.stt.2.dat is output from L<Graph::Easy::Marpa::DFA> V 0.70, and can be used
instead of t/sample.stt.1.dat in the above code.

=head1 Description

Takes a L<Set::FA::Element>-style state transition table and converts it into a graph.

You can write the result in any format supported by L<Graphviz|http://www.graphviz.org/>.

Here is the list of L<output formats|http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats>.

=head1 Distributions

This module is available as a Unix-style distro (*.tgz).

See L<http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/installing-a-module.html>
for help on unpacking and installing distros.

=head1 Installation

Install L<GraphViz2> as you would for any C<Perl> module:

Run:

	cpanm GraphViz2

or run:

	sudo cpan GraphViz2

or unpack the distro, and then either:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	sudo ./Build install

or:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make (or dmake or nmake)
	make test
	make install

=head1 Constructor and Initialization

=head2 Calling new()

C<new()> is called as C<< my($obj) = GraphViz2::Parse::STT -> new(k1 => v1, k2 => v2, ...) >>.

It returns a new object of type C<GraphViz2::Parse::STT>.

Key-value pairs accepted in the parameter list:

=over 4

=item o graph => $graphviz_object

This option specifies the GraphViz2 object to use. This allows you to configure it as desired.

The default is GraphViz2->new. The default attributes are the same as in the synopsis, above.

This key is optional.

=back

=head1 Methods

=head2 create(stt => $state_transition_table)

Creates the graph, which is accessible via the graph() method, or via the graph object you passed to new().

Returns $self for method chaining.

$state_transition_table is a list of arrayrefs, each with 3 elements.

That is, it is the I<contents> of the arrayref 'transitions', which is one of the keys in the parameter list
to L<Set::FA::Element>'s new().

A quick summary of each element of this list, where each element is an arrayref with 3 elements:

=over 4

=item o [0] A state name

=item o [1] A regexp

=item o [2] Another state name (which may be the same as the first)

=back

The DFA in L<Set::FA::Element> tests the 'current' state against the state name ([0]), and for each state name
which matches, tests the regexp ([1]) against the next character in the input stream. The first regexp to match
causes the DFA to transition to the state named in the 3rd element of the arrayref ([2]).

See t/sample.stt.1.dat for an example.

=head2 graph()

Returns the graph object, either the one supplied to new() or the one created during the call to new().

=head1 Thanks

Many thanks are due to the people who chose to make L<Graphviz|http://www.graphviz.org/> Open Source.

And thanks to L<Leon Brocard|http://search.cpan.org/~lbrocard/>, who wrote L<GraphViz>, and kindly gave me co-maint of the module.
